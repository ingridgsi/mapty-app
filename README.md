## Project Overview

This project is a Workout Tracker web application that allows users to record their workouts, including running and cycling sessions. Users can enter workout details such as type, distance, duration, cadence (for running), and elevation gain (for cycling). The app displays the user's workouts on both a map and in a list, making it easy to visualize and track their exercise history.
